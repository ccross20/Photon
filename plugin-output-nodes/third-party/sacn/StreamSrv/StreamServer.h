/*StreamServer.h  Definition of the CStreamServer class.
This class acts as a streaming ACN server.  It allows you to instance universes,
and will automatically send the buffer for a universe periodically, based on a 
call to Tick

Normal usage:
-For each universe you want to source:
   - If you are sourcing data with per-channel-priorities, call
     CreateUniverse with a startcode of STARTCODE_PRIORITY, ignore_inactivity_logic
     set to IGNORE_INACTIVE_PRIORITY, and send_intervalms set to SEND_INTERVAL_PRIORITY.
     You will receive a data buffer and universe handle that you can use to manipulate
     the per-channel priorities.  0 is not a valid universe number
   - Call CreateUniverse with a startcode of STARTCODE_DMX.  You will receive a data buffer
     and handle that you can use to manipulate the data you are sourcing.
-call Tick at your DMX rate (e.g. every 23 ms) to drive the sending rate.
-Whenever you change data in the buffer, set the universe dirty.  This includes the initial
 setting of the values in a static look!  This class won't send out a universe until it 
 is marked dirty for the first time.
-When you're done with a universe, destroy it.  Keep calling Tick until it returns a 0,
 otherwise you won't send out all the recommended "terminated" packets for that universe

	// and depending on how you created each universe performs the DMX inactivity logic.
	//This function returns the current number of valid universes in the system.  
	//This function also handles sending the extra packets with the terminated flag set, and destroys

  //  inactivity logic, send_intervalms expiry will trigger a resend of the current universe packet.
  //Data on this universe will not be initially sent until marked dirty.
